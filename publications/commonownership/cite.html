abstract = {This paper analyses the impact of common ownership on
					markups and innovation and adds to the discussion of the recently
					observed patterns of a long term rise in market power. Using a rich
					panel of European manufacturing firms from 2005 to 2016, we
					structurally infer markups and construct a measure of common ownership.
					We use a propensity score reweighting estimator to eliminate biases
					due to observational characteristics and find an increase of firm
					markups ranging up to 3.4\% in industries with high technological
					spillovers after the first exposure to common ownership. For companies
					directly held by common institutional investors, we also measure a
					positive effect on citation-weighted patents of up to 9.5\% in
					high-spillover industries. Both findings are consistent with recent
					theoretical findings in López and Vives (2019). We further exploit
					industry technology classifications by the European Commission to shed
				  some light on the heterogeneity of the effect of common ownership
					across the sample.}, <br />
